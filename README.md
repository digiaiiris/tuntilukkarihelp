## Chrome Extension Installation

The current Workday integration requires a custom extensions installed on Chrome.
(In the future, integration will be updated to use a different API that does not need extensions.)

To install the extension:

1. Download the [extension](https://d2sbbz5gutol4d.cloudfront.net/extension.zip)
2. Extract `extension.zip` anywhere on your computer (just a temporary place, can be eg. under Windows `Downloads` folder)
3. Open chrome://extensions/ url on a Chrome tab
4. Toggle `Developer mode` ON in the top right corner of the extensions page
5. Click `Load unpacked` and select the folder where you unzipped the extension
